# Semantic-UI-Presets (Still under construction)
<p>As an Back-End developer you sometimes need a GUI real quick for <b>testing purposes</b> or for a project <b>without an Front-End Developer</b>.
In time of needs i made these presets in <b>Semantic UI</b> for quick access for different parts that can be implemented into a project.
</p>
<p>I have now more time to focus on the Back-End development.</p>
